# THA-4: Chinese Aid to Africa

## Research Question: Which countries in Africa recieve the most/least aid from China? 
- My research question focuses on Chinese aid commitments to the African continent. This dataset can be found here: [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org). AidData compiles Chinese aid commitments from 2000-2014. To add additional context to these commitments, I also used GDP Per Capita numbers by country from: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org).  
- The goal is to see which countries in Africa recieve aid and if there are any interesting patterns when these aid commitments are mapped. 
- Inferences will be made through a simple linear regression and descriptive statistics (see Python analysis) and through plot.ly (see chart below)
